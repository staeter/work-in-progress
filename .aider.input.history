# 2024-11-05 23:45:45.348870

+/ask lets go one by one. On "Strong privacy makes it harder to build collective knowledge and shared spaces" Private means that each person decides who accesses which part of their data. People can decide to share parts of it whithin a certain circle of users or even post it publicly if they wish so. The crucial aspect of private is the user's control. Rephrase this point in a simple and concise sentence or two

# 2024-12-08 20:49:25.695979
+/ask there are different spaces. It is like a city, you have your home for private discutions and the city hall for public discource. It is not a question of privacy settings. This point is made in contrast with platforms like Facebook where even you private discutions are used as data for targeted advertisement or are shared with secret services if requested. 

# 2024-12-08 20:56:16.933191
+/ask no because as you said "Group decision-making often requires some level of identity verification and anonymous participation can complicate democratic processes". Try listing some solutions to this issue.

# 2024-12-08 21:00:43.541360
+/ask all of these are really interesting and correct though there is one issue. How do you prove its not a bot?

# 2024-12-08 21:18:21.675795
+/ask the solution will depend on the context. I prefer the proof of personhood as it is the most reliable. The idea is for people to scan qr codes on one another's devices in order to show they have a physical human connection. Based on that they can form networks of people that have been proved to one an other. Though there is a bysantine attack possible by getting someone included in the network verifying bot accounts but this can be tracked down by analyzing the network and seeing that those bots have few edges connecting them to the rest of the network. Try to rephrase this idea

# 2024-12-09 08:43:55.381638
+/ask I like the first as this principle focuses on user aquisition and retention. The other principles might be commpelling reasons as they might match users values but its not enough as other open source social media show. You still need ways to attract new users

# 2024-12-09 08:46:33.262894

+/ask I realised that the progressibe principle is too vague. It doesn't indicate what the positive goal is. Its up to interpretation and could be misused relative to my actual intentions. What I consider to be positive change is things that move toward the abolition exploitation, the developement of sciences. Things that improve humanity's control over its future.

# 2024-12-12 18:04:04.520539

This firt step of initiating the fight is the hardest one as you need examples that show progress is possible but when you do not have any concrete examples in your lifetime it gets really hard to get anything started. The optimistic prinsiple really is there to make that first inital push of being hopeful about the future.

+/ask the implementation part isn't clear in this verion. There are different ways to shape this up and it mostly revolves around the platforms culture and the insentives that content creators are encouraged to follow

# 2024-12-14 10:45:57.319780
+/ask only rewrite the last paragraph. Ways to implement might be to encourage content creators to do this through content creation tips and tutorials. It can also be slightly influenced via the kinds of metricks that are tracked down and valorised in the statistics menu or even via algorithmic design.

# 2024-12-14 10:49:04.231925
+/ask rewrite this paragraph from the respecful rationale as the methods of acting will essentially the same as for optimism. "This principle not only guides community norms but also technical design as some design patterns can be used to encourage respectful behaviors. Possible patterns might be to prompt users to reconsider potentially harmful messages before sending them or ask users to emphasize constructive feedback over negative reactions in the comment box placeholder."

+/ask lets rewrite the purposeful rationale with this context/meaning/non goals/implementation paragraphs

# 2024-12-14 11:17:12.510451
+/ask take more inspiration with the current rationale but keep this paragraph structure : "In the recent decades we saw the rise of the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) where corporations compete to grab users attention at all costs. This provokes a profound disregard for users wants and needs with invasive and addictive design practices. This also has the effect of harming the public discourse by filling front pages with attention grabbing, anger and fear mongering content.
+
+For a platform to be purposeful means it empowers users to shape their platform experience according to their own goals and values. This involves providing tools for self-reflection and usage insights. It means giving the users ways to turn on or off potentially addictive patterns and help them maintain an healthy relationship with the online world."

+/ask based on the expressive principle "Provide spaces for creative expression and knowledge sharing and embrace diverse voices and experiences." make a bulet list of things that we would find in every paragraph of its rationale

# 2024-12-14 16:25:48.877349
+/ask what are the core caracteristics of the expressive principle?

# 2024-12-14 16:28:47.513906
+/ask structure those with the rationale paragraphs

# 2024-12-14 17:03:41.334246
+/ask "Current platforms often standardize expression into rigid formats" is not exact, despite the standard video format many things can be expressed on youtube (feat and fun, video essay, ...) but it is true that the youtube algorithm favors some formats over others wich is an issue as you don't have any alternative recomandation system. Though this issue matches the empowering principle.  "Knowledge sharing is fragmented across different platforms" Dialogue doesn't aim to solve this necessarely. "One-size-fits-all spaces limit creative possibilities" there are different platforms for different forms of expression but Dialogue aims at hosting many different content formats. The issue tackled by expressive is both to provide spaces (with various content formats) to share experiences and to support people with doing that. This can be done by helping them to get revenue from their work (crowd funding/connecting with advertisers and goodies producers/democratic production fund) by supporting young creators, etc. Existing platforms have a few very influential creators that get really quite wealthy and many that struggle with maintinging their activity. We want to put smaller content creators first as they diversify point of views and voices.

# 2024-12-14 17:11:29.494348
+/ask one more aspect is that we want to avoid the race to publication as on other platforms. This pressurises the content creators and encourage low production quality content. The problem isn't that some creators get wealthy but that they get too influential compared to the rest of the network. Support systems favor established creators but also the ones that matches the interest of the platform private owner. The "what it means" part is really good, keep it. Not about replacing other platforms but about proposing alternatives. Not sure what "Not about standardizing support mechanisms" means. The implementation part also is really good. I'd add an element of encouraging creators to support one an other.

# 2024-12-14 17:16:18.459642
+/ask the pressure to publish also favors private companies that can produce huge amounts of content. The creator support programs are encouraged and supported by the platform features bus are done by the users themselves as they know best. Appart from that your structure seems good and you can turn it into a first draft

# 2024-12-14 17:20:11.068748
+/ask I really don't like the first paragraph. The previous rationale contained better ideas "Providing spaces for expression means building the infrastructure people need to share their creativity and knowledge. This goes beyond just allowing content posting - it requires tools for different forms of expression, from text to multimedia.
+
+Embracing diverse voices means actively considering different perspectives in the design process and ensuring the platform works well for people from all backgrounds."

# 2024-12-14 21:13:43.451480
+/ask I wrote the first paragraph of the expressive principle's rationale: "The world wide web brought an unprecedented ability for people to share ideas and knowledge across the world but - as the [platform economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_economy) grew - private corporation took control over our means of communication and entertainment. It still is really tedious to distribute content without hosting it on these private infrastructures and that's without considering ways of funding the content's production." It lacks one aspect that I want to mention but struggle to find the right formulation. It is about the fact that creators with large audience tend to grow their visibility exponentially where as smaller content creators struggle to grow their core audience.

# 2024-12-17 12:38:17.229957
+/ask Keep the first paragraph it is quite good. The empowering principle is also about giving users control over the metrics and algorithms that guide their attention. It actually is a bit more philosophical and is about the capability of users to chose for themselves.

# 2024-12-22 11:15:40.704722
+/ask I'm working on a new informative principle "Collectively gather information, make independent journalism the standard and ensure the quality and fairness of the reporting." I'd like to improve this short description. The main idea is to have some sort of crowd news where people mey take videos of things happening around them, those videos would be associated with their gps positions and their time to be crossed with others users videos. That content could be then used by a crowd of independent investigators that would cross and verify information to buid reports and document various events that happend. This comes with tools for helping with that collective investigation process while ensuring that investigation process gets made with the best paractices of journalism. Then a second aspect of that principle is that the reporting of those news should be balanced with their relative concrete inpact and significance. Current day media tend to create the feeling of growing insecurity by over reporting on crimes compared to their actual occurence. So this principle works in three parts and makes each collective: information gathering, investigation and reporting. Each step has to be transparent, democratic and independent

# 2024-12-22 11:22:07.164297
+/ask how does this principle diferenciates itself with others?

# 2024-12-22 11:27:41.536435
+/ask I agree with your point except with the "4. Make the verification process more central" which goes against distrbuted and democratic. Yes I believe it overlaps quite a bit so I won't add id directly. Though it would be interesging to integrete this idea of crowd news and fair reporting into the other princples like democratic or expressive.

# 2024-12-22 11:30:41.126761
+/ask Yes lets integrate these ideas to each principle one by one starting with the expressive principle.

# 2024-12-22 11:37:56.891891
+/ask Your changes removed some ideas I liked in the previous text like the emphasis on the different valuable purposes of content (knowledge sharing, entertainment, etc.) as well as the tools and resources provided to help creators sustain their work.

+/ask what are the core ideas of the attractive principles

# 2024-12-22 23:46:55.117463
+/ask on the 4th point the only valid formulation is the "Communities should find value in growing on the platform" one. Appart from that you properly described the general intention. Please draft a rationale

# 2024-12-22 23:51:27.652552
+/ask lets take paragraphs one by one. The first one sould talk about other things than the pure network effect which is quite theorical and unembodied. One of the great feet of the internet was for friends that lost touch with one an other and are living on opposite sides of the world to find one an other online and keep their relationship alive. Its not just an economical use its also about human connection. If the platform stays empty it won't be of use to anyone.

# 2024-12-22 23:53:58.386515
+/ask I think you can make this slightly more synthetic. I really like the last sentence " A social network needs to attract and retain enough users to make these connections possible, otherwise even the best features become meaningless in an empty space."

# 2024-12-22 23:57:06.766155
+/ask ok lets go to the next paragraph which should be about what this principle is about (the next is about what it isn't)

# 2024-12-23 00:06:36.428376
+/ask stop copying the previous paragraph and focus on the one we are talking about. It isn't only about features but also about mecanisms. For instance Nebula has a great mecanism that drives users form youtube towards their platform. Creators are sponsored by nebula on youtube and encourage their audiences to go to nebula to support them by watching their content plus some exclusive shows on nebula. This drives creator's revenue as well as the growth of nebula. This forms a positive feedback loop. You can explain the mecanism but do not cite other platforms in the rationale. Though the mecanism itself should be expressed in the fourth paragraph.Here simply extend the meaning of what attractive is by adding to features (which are also part of if) full on onboarding mecanisms

# 2024-12-23 00:08:29.918100
+/ask ok this one is good. Lets go to the paragraph on what the attractive principle isn't about

# 2024-12-23 00:11:06.652070
+/ask Great first go. Lets make the last paragraph on possible practical implementations and implications

# 2024-12-23 00:15:46.546544
+/ask your citation of "sponsorship systems" is too vague and can be missunderstood. Cite also possible exclusive content financed either by the platform itself or by crowdfunding. What do you mean by discovery features?

# 2024-12-23 00:19:59.885602
+/ask its also about being focused on creators interests and needs we can bring creators on board and genuenly recomend Dialogue to their comunities. Same with being genuenly pro users we can attract good word of mouth adverdising.

# 2024-12-23 00:21:56.514802
+/ask there is room for improvement on this last paragraph. What could be improved 

# 2024-12-23 00:28:07.226716
+/ask I'd like to add a crucial aspect which is that one aim is to create a bond of trust and a co building relationship with both users and creators which is key to the word of mouth part. The second aspect is about reaching people that never heard about the platform and that is where the exclusive content and the nebula example come in. (Do not cite nebula here)

# 2024-12-23 00:38:19.536391
+/ask lets do the same for the private principle. Propose the first paragraph of its rationale about the context of the principle

# 2024-12-23 00:39:56.945874
+/ask perfect. Second paragraph

# 2024-12-23 00:41:23.057060
+/ask great. Third

# 2024-12-23 00:43:03.795110
+/ask Ok still perfect. Last paragraph

# 2024-12-23 00:44:47.576620
+/ask ok you failed. I asked you for the fourth paragraph in the private principle rationale. Here is what we have until now: "Traditional social platforms treat user data as a commodity to be exploited - selling it to advertisers, training AI models without consent, sharing it with third parties, and readily handing it over to state surveillance. This creates a situation where every interaction, every connection, and every piece of content becomes potential leverage against users, whether for commercial manipulation or state control. Even "private" messages and closed groups are ultimately accessible to platform owners and their partners.
+
+Privacy means giving users genuine control over their data and communications. This extends beyond basic settings to fundamental control over where data is stored, who can access it, and how it's used. Users should understand what data they're generating, have meaningful choices about its storage and sharing, and trust that their private communications remain truly private through strong encryption and transparent security measures.
+
+This isn't about making all content completely private or preventing any form of sharing. Rather, it's about ensuring users have real control and understanding of their privacy choices. The platform should make it easy to share safely when desired while maintaining strong privacy by default and protecting users from accidental exposure."

# 2024-12-23 13:11:58.697437
+/ask In the respectful rationale's first paragraph, there is an aspect I would like to describe there. Often social medias are spaces where differences are shamed and public humiliation are common place. These are extreamly harmfull behaviours

# 2024-12-23 13:14:27.232821
+/ask actualy the respecful term might not be strong enough for this principle. Propose a few alternatives

# 2024-12-23 13:24:41.056382
+/ask Ok I took Humanizing it perfectly matches my idea. Though now I realise that the rationale might be improved by emphesizing something slightly different. Write a new first paragraph starting with "When we interact online, we tend to forget that there are human beings on the other side of the screen." Keep the ideas fromthe previous version in there but take the angle of focusing on human interaction instead of people in power wanting to divide us

# 2024-12-23 22:29:26.299396
+/ask ok none of those. Lets skip this paragraph and write the practical implications of the resilient principle

# 2024-12-28 11:31:57.639216
+/ask Here is what I have for the resilient principle "Traditional social platforms are vulnerable to disruption - whether from technical failures, corporate decisions, or state intervention. A single point of failure in their centralized infrastructure can cut off millions of users from their communities. More concerning still, governments can easily pressure these platforms to censor content, block access, or hand over user data, effectively silencing entire populations with a single decision.
+
+Being resilient means ensuring the platform keeps working even under adverse conditions. This requires both technical and social resilience - from maintaining basic functionality during network outages to preserving the platform's governance during targeted disruption attempts. The platform should be able to adapt and recover from failures, help users route around censorship, and maintain essential services even when parts of the network are compromised or blocked.
+
+Build the app as [local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) and communicate between devices using [disruption-tolerant networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking). These mechanisms ensure communities can stay connected and functional even when facing technical or political disruption." The last paragraph seems a bit handwaivy.

# 2024-12-30 10:13:28.075325
+/ask Ok I got this piece of text "Modularity enables community-driven development without compromising the other *core principles*. It requires careful API design and sandboxing to allow customization without compromising the platform's values. This principle doesn't cover the whole codebase as the program's protocols and architecture have to stay unified but it should cover all things that have an impact on the way users interact with one an other. From recommendation algorithms to interface layouts, from content moderation tools to interaction metrics, communities should be able to adapt or replace components to match their specific needs and values." but I don't like its structure. List its essencial ideas and write it anew to see if you can do better

# 2024-12-30 10:24:41.910858
+/ask lets write the last paragraph on the practical implications of the modular principle. There is an idea I want to find there that hasn't been stated yet which is that we need a space where packages are shared and discussed openly and that that space might also serve to build up the core platform as some packages get very successful they might be integreted as defaults.
