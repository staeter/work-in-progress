# elm-monorepo

Cli tool that makes parallel development of multiple packages and apps seamless by grouping them into a single repo.

`elm-monorepo` moves packages in your `src` folder for you to modify and test in context before pushing it back, eventually forking the repo and publishing a new package version.
