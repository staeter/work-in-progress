# Dialogue

Through sciences and technologies, humanity has gained mastery over nature but its social organization is still subordinated to individualistic short term interests. Deep systemic changes are needed for humanity to gain conscious control over its future and overcome the quagmires threatening it.

This new socio-economic organization of society must be built by the masses voluntarily governing themselves. It therefore has to go beyond national boundaries, welcome humanity's intrinsic diversity and defend a positivist view of liberty. Thereby arises the need for tools enabling large scale collective organizing and decision making able to support the advent of such political order.

Building this social network is a humongous task that can only be completed with the coordination of a large pool of engineers, programers, designers, journalists and other content creators. This document is a first attempt at clarifying the requirements in order to structure and orient everyone's work toward a clear and unified goal.

## Core Principles

These core principles describe the general goals of the project and serve as its north star. Every requirement and every feature has to be justified and can be debated relative to these principles.

1. **Empathic**: Support users physical and mental wellbeing and foster goodwill, empathy, openness and constructive communication.
2. **Optimistic**: Build confidence in our collective ability to overcome current challenges and shape better futures through human ingenuity and collective action.
3. **Empowering**: Entrust people with control over their digital environment and support them with appropriate tools.
4. **Expressive**: Provide spaces and tools for creative expression and knowledge sharing and embrace diverse voices and experiences.
5. **Informative**: Create community-driven systems for news gathering, investigation, and proportional reporting.
6. **Democratic**: Make bottom up, collective human organizing and decision-making more efficient and accessible than centralized systems.
7. **Accessible**: Ensure accessibility to as many people as possible by considering technical knowledge, economical status, cultural background, physical disabilities, language and literacy.
8. **Attractive**: Has compelling reasons for people and communities to join, stay and grow with the platform.
9. **Private**: Guarantee personal data sovereignty and communication confidentiality.
10. **Resilient**: Maintain platform availability and usability even under state-level interdiction.
11. **Safe**: Ensure users can communicate without fear of identification or retribution even in repressive environments.
12. **Modular**: Support community-driven development with a secure framework making every interface and algorithm customizable.
13. **Independent**: Organize platform architecture and governance in a way that ensures independence from state and corporate interests in order to stay true to the *core principles*.
14. **Sustainable**: Ensure the platform's social and technical foundations remain viable and relevant across generational timescales.
15. **Empirical**: Rigorously justify, study and stress test every feature to ensure its functioning truly matches its intent.
16. **Transparent**: Actively expose and explain all platform mechanisms, algorithmic systems, and community processes, enabling informed user participation and control.

The principles 1-3 are philosophical, 4-8 social, 9-12 technical and 13-16 methodological. Apart from these groupings, they are sorted in no particular order. The numbers are only there for referencing sake.

## Rationale

In this section we detail every principle, we express its underlying rationale, what it is, what it isn't and some practical implications. The important part here is to convey Dialogue's general intent.

### 1. Empathic

When we interact online, we tend to forget that there are human beings on the other side of the screen. This distance makes it easier to ignore others' humanity, leading to behaviors we would rarely engage in face-to-face: going from simple carelessness to harassment and public shaming. These toxic behaviors isolates peoples, encourages stale interactions and deepens social divisions. We want to build bridges and have spaces for people to dialogue with one another.

Being empathic means fostering an environment where people feel safe to express themselves and engage with others constructively. This goes beyond basic politeness - it requires actively designing systems that encourage empathy, honesty, mutual understanding, good faith communication and that supports users mental and physical wellbeing.

This doesn't mean avoiding hard or violent topics, nor does it mean abolishing debate or disagreement. It simply means to make ones best effort to reach the other, try to understand their point of view and progress from there.

Community guidelines and content creation tutorials can encourage empathetic communication, default platform metrics can track and highlight constructive interactions rather than inflammatory ones, default recommender systems can show diverse perspectives to break information bubbles and default interfaces can prompt users to reconsider harmful messages before publishing. These mechanisms help shape a culture where seeking to understand others becomes as natural as expressing oneself.

### 2. Optimistic

In times of global challenges and systemic crises, it's easy to fall into doom scrolling and cynicism. This constant exposure to problems without solutions creates a paralyzing feedback loop: seeing no examples of positive change makes it harder to believe in or work toward solutions, which in turn means fewer positive examples for others.

Building confidence in our collective ability to overcome current challenges means breaking this cycle. This comes by sharing practical experiences and organizing to create new ones. When people see concrete examples of progress being made or being fought for, taking that first step toward engagement becomes possible.

This doesn't mean ignoring problems or promoting blind optimism. It simply means maintaining faith in human ingenuity and working towards concrete solutions. The platform should encourage content creators users stay informed about challenges while emphasizing where action can be taken and positive change happens or is being fought for.

Community guidelines and content creation tutorials can encourage solution-focused storytelling, default platform metrics can track and highlight constructive engagement rather than just reach, and default recommendation systems can be designed to balance problem awareness with solution-finding initiatives. These mechanisms help shape a culture where sharing progress and celebrating small wins becomes as natural as identifying challenges.

### 3. Empowering

Traditional platforms treat users as passive consumers of content and features, offering little control over their digital environment beyond superficial customization options. This creates learned helplessness where users accept whatever changes platforms impose, even when these changes work against their interests or needs. This problem is particularly visible in the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) where corporations compete to grab users' attention at all costs, using invasive and addictive design practices with profound disregard for users' wants and needs.

Empowering means trusting users' capacity to make informed choices about their digital lives. This is about interface customization, recommendation algorithms, content filtering, interaction metrics, and information presentation. Users should understand how these systems affect their behavior and have meaningful ways to adjust or replace them to align with their own purposes and values.

This principle is about respecting users' autonomy and supporting their growth from passive consumers to active participants who understand and control their digital environment. The platform should make visible the mechanisms that guide behavior and provide tools to modify them according to personal values and goals.

Transparent algorithms that users can understand and modify, usage dashboards that help users self-reflect, customizable metrics that align with personal values rather than engagement maximization, and settings to modify or disable potentially addictive features. These mechanisms help users reclaim agency over their online experience and maintain a healthy relationship with technology.

### 4. Expressive

The world wide web brought an unprecedented ability for people to share ideas and knowledge across the world but - as the [platform economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_economy) grew - private corporations took control over our means of communication and entertainment. These platforms not only amplify already-popular voices while making it increasingly difficult for new or niche creators to reach and grow their audience, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of visibility inequality, but they also readily comply with state censorship demands, further limiting the diversity of voices and ideas that can be expressed online.

To follow the expressive principle means to provide diverse peoples ways to express, publish, share and sustain creative work. It includes hosting dissident voices. This involves supporting creators, making tools and resources that help them initiate their creative work, find their core audience and open multiple paths to sustainable content creation.

This isn't about limiting successful creators or forcing equality of outcomes. Rather, it means ensuring that success comes from genuine audience connection and content quality rather than algorithmic bias. The goal is to create multiple viable paths to sustainable content creation, where both niche creators serving specific communities and broadly popular voices can thrive.

In practice this comes down to handling various content formats (from text articles to long-form video passing by digital comics), having discovery pages for each of them recommending content based on a variety of metrics and algorithms. To make content production sustainable the platform may integrate crowd funding systems and a page to connect creators and advertisers.

### 5. Informative

Traditional media outlets have consolidated into massive conglomerates whose coverage inevitably aligns with their owners' interests. Meanwhile, social platforms shape public perception through algorithmic amplification that prioritizes engagement over truthfulness. This creates distorted views of reality - sensationalizing certain events while overlooking others, amplifying extreme voices while marginalizing nuanced perspectives. The result is a media landscape where even basic facts become contested territory and where the real significance of events gets lost in a flood of decontextualized content.

Being informative means providing community-driven systems for gathering, verifying, sharing and contextualizing news. This first requires tools for information gathering, sourcing, cross-referencing, investigation and communication. No news covering is truly neutral and being informative also is about making the ideology underlying the presented facts explicit and to contrast it with the way it is presented through different ideological lenses.

This isn't about creating a centralized truth authority or enforcing a single perspective. Rather, it's about providing tools and processes that help communities collectively investigate and document events and encourage them to look across the isle and have a fair view of the opposing perspectives. The goal is to enable rigorous collaborative journalism without creating new gatekeepers or compromising the diversity of viewpoints.

The platform realizes this principle through several complementary mechanisms. For gathering and verifying information, it provides geotagged and timestamped content that can be cross-referenced between witnesses, along with collaborative investigation tools to connect related pieces of evidence. For ensuring coverage quality, reputation systems track journalistic integrity while a suite of tools helps balance coverage priorities: statistical comparisons show how coverage frequency matches real-world occurrence, impact assessment tools measure the scope and duration of effects, communities can define and weight different impact factors, and contextual presentation highlights trends rather than isolated incidents. Default user's interface contrasts their news viewed through different ideological lenses. Together, these mechanisms support rigorous collective journalism that reflects real-world significance and diversity of opinions rather than entertainment value.

### 6. Democratic

Traditional social platforms tend to concentrate power in the hands of platform owners and their algorithms, leaving users and communities with little say in how their spaces are governed. Even when platforms offer community moderation tools, these are often limited and can be overridden by corporate decisions driven by profit motives rather than community needs.

This is also true at a wider scale in corporate and political environment where power is centralized in the hands of the wealthy. Dialogue wants to be a space for the masses to organize, struggle against oppression and decide collectively what future they want to craft for humanity.

Democratic organization means creating spaces where communities can effectively self-govern and make collective decisions. This requires not just voting mechanisms, but comprehensive tools for discussion, investigation, deliberation, consensus-building, and transparent decision-making. The platform must support various forms of democratic governance - from direct democracy to representative systems - while keeping processes clear and accessible to all participants. The different communities and organizations have to be able to take joint decisions, make joint statements and coordinate through the platform.

The democratic principle isn't about forcing every group to use the same democratic model. Rather, it's about making democratic organization more efficient and accessible than centralized control. Communities should be able to choose and evolve their governance structures while maintaining transparency and accountability to their members.

Built-in tools for proposals and voting, structured discussion spaces for investigation and deliberation, tools for collaborative work, transparent record-keeping of decisions and their rationales, and flexible permission systems that communities can adapt to their needs. These mechanisms help make collective decision-making and organizing as fast and more efficient as centralized systems.

### 7. Accessible

Large segments of the population are excluded of the online discourse through various barriers: expensive devices or data plans, complex interfaces that assume technical literacy, designs that don't work with assistive technologies, content available only in majority languages, poor internet access or non [net neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) internet providers. This creates digital divides that reinforce existing social inequalities and limit the internet's potential for inclusive dialogue and collective action.

Making a social platform truly accessible means considering every feature through multiple lenses:

- Technical: Works on low-end devices and slow/intermittent connections
- Economical: Free to use with minimal hardware requirements
- Cultural: Respects and accommodates different cultural norms and practices
- Physical: Compatible with assistive technologies and follows accessibility standards
- Linguistical: Available in multiple languages with clear paths for community translation
- Educational: Usable regardless of technical literacy or formal education level

Being accessible is about thoughtful development. We have to think every functionality from the start to be nice and easy to use for everyone.

Responsive interfaces that work across device types, offline-first architecture that handles poor connectivity, built-in translation tools, context-sensitive help systems, and careful attention to accessibility standards. These mechanisms ensure that no one is excluded from participating in the platform's community.

### 8. Attractive

One of the internet's greatest achievements has been helping people maintain meaningful connections across time and distance - old friends finding each other again and families staying close despite living continents apart. But this only works when people can actually find each other on a platform. A social network needs to attract and retain enough users to make these connections possible, otherwise even the best features become meaningless in an empty space.

Being attractive means designing features and mechanisms that give people genuine reasons to join and stay on the platform. This requires both understanding what brings real value to users' lives - whether that's reconnecting with old friends, finding communities that share their interests, or discovering new perspectives - and creating sustainable growth mechanisms that benefit both users and creators. The platform should grow through authentic utility, meaningful interactions, and positive feedback loops that align everyone's interests.

We want to avoid using dark patterns, artificial virality, or manipulative engagement tactics to drive growth. Rather, being attractive is about creating genuine value that makes people want to join and stay. The platform should grow through word-of-mouth and demonstrated utility, not through exploiting psychological vulnerabilities or creating artificial urgency.

Building trust through genuine collaboration with creators and users is key to enable the best advertisement there is: word of mouth. In order to get there we need to support creators and users success through community building tools and sustainable revenue models, and to foster a co-building relationship where their feedback shapes the platform's evolution. To reach new user bases platform-funded and crowdfunded exclusive content can attract new audiences and creators can introduce their communities to the platform through cross-platform content strategies.

### 9. Private

Traditional social platforms treat user data as a commodity to be exploited - selling it to advertisers, training AI models without consent, sharing it with third parties, and readily handing it over to state surveillance. This creates a situation where every interaction, every connection, and every piece of content becomes potential leverage against users, whether for commercial manipulation or state control. Even "private" messages and closed groups are ultimately accessible to platform owners and their partners.

Privacy means giving users genuine control over their data and communications. This extends beyond basic settings to fundamental control over where data is stored, who can access it, and how it's used. Users should understand what data they're generating, have meaningful choices about its storage and sharing, and trust that their private communications remain truly private through strong encryption and transparent security measures.

The aim isn't for all content to be completely private. Rather, it's about ensuring users have real control and understanding of who gets access to which piece of data. The platform should make it easy to share safely when desired while maintaining strong privacy by default and protecting users from accidental exposure.

Strong encryption protects all communications by default, clear interfaces help users understand and control their privacy settings, they get to decide where to store their data, transparent documentation explains how data is stored and processed and granular sharing controls let users decide exactly what to share with whom. These mechanisms ensure users maintain genuine sovereignty over their data while making safe sharing straightforward when desired.

### 10. Resilient

Traditional social platforms are vulnerable to disruption - whether from technical failures, corporate decisions, or state intervention. A single point of failure in their centralized infrastructure can cut off millions of users from their communities. More concerning still, governments can easily pressure these platforms to censor content, block access, or hand over user data, effectively silencing entire populations with a single decision.

Being resilient means ensuring the platform keeps working even under adverse conditions. This requires both technical and social resilience - from maintaining basic functionality during network outages to preserving the platform's governance during targeted disruption attempts. The platform should be able to adapt and recover from failures, help users route around censorship, and maintain essential services even when parts of the network are compromised or blocked.

Build the app's communications as a trustless peer to peer distributed system with no cental node. Follow the best practices in [disruption-tolerant networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking). Structure data as [conflict-free replicated data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) and propose [cooperative storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_storage_cloud) to duplicate data across users' devices. Keep the interfaces as functional as possible even without network access. This principle also has implications for the platform's governance. The core developers' team should be organized with resilience in mind as its members might be pressured or even be missing.

### 11. Safe

In many parts of the world, expressing certain views or identities online can lead to real-world persecution. Journalists, whistle-blowers, activists, minorities, and ordinary peoples face harassment, job loss, imprisonment, or worse when their online activities are traced back to them. Traditional platforms not only fail to protect vulnerable users, but often actively cooperate with oppressive entities by providing user data or implementing automated surveillance systems that can be weaponized against their users.

Being safe means ensuring users can communicate without fear of identification or retribution, particularly in repressive environments. This requires strong online anonymity and untraceability, protections against online harassment and exposure as well as undetectability by [network sniffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack) and [spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware). The platform should provide tools and practices that help users maintain their safety while still enabling meaningful participation in their communities.

Strong anonymity by default protect user identities, content warnings and filtering tools help users avoid unwanted exposure, reporting mechanisms enable communities to protect themselves against harassment and safety documentation helps users understand risks and best practices. The platform's security has to be heavily tested and be impervious against spoofing attacks. Ideally the app should also be [polymorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code) to avoid detection by spyware and it should be able to disguise its communications in order to be unrecognizable by anyone tapping the network.

### 12. Modular

No platform is neutral - its design inherently shapes what gets expressed and how people interact. From recommendation algorithms that determine what content gets seen, to interface choices that guide behavior, to moderation systems that define acceptable speech - every technical choice embodies specific values and priorities. While we strive to align these choices with our *core principles*, we recognize that no single implementation can serve all communities' needs or adapt to every contexts.

Modularity enables communities to adapt how they interact with the platform while maintaining its fundamental integrity. Through carefully designed APIs and secure sandboxing, communities can customize their experience - from recommendation algorithms to interface layouts, from moderation tools to interaction metrics - all while the platform's core architecture and protocols remain unified and secure. This allows each community to shape their environment according to their specific needs and values without compromising the platform's other *core principles* (with the exception of the three philosophical principles which only relate to default options).

The platform realizes this principle through secure APIs for safe extension development, sandboxed environments that protect core functionality and a dedicated space where communities share and discuss their custom packages. As extensions prove their value through widespread adoption and community vetting, they can be considered for integration into the platform's default offering, creating a pathway for community-driven evolution of the core platform itself.

### 13. Independent

Most social platforms are beholden to corporate interests and vulnerable to state control. Whether through profit motives driving harmful engagement tactics, advertisers influencing content policies, or governments demanding user data and censorship compliance, these dependencies fundamentally compromise platforms' ability to serve their users' interests. The result is a social media landscape where neither users nor platform operators can maintain genuine autonomy in pursuing their stated values and goals.

Independence implies the strong rejection of the profit motive in general and opportunism amongst the people involved. Money has to be used only as a tool needed to build the platform but it must never be confused with the final goal. It is needed to ensure the platform stays true to its *core principles* and to resist both corporate capture and state control.

Systems have to share [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_artificial_intelligence) and [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_storage_cloud) loads across all users devices to avoid dependency to any cloud provider. This also lower the maintenance costs and limits the dependency on revenue sources. The source of revenue have to be varied and preferably come from the users who have the most interest in upholding the *core principles*. The org must not grow dependent on any other source of revenue - like advertisement or subsidies - as they may be used to pressure the org if it grows too dependent on them.

To prevent opportunism amongst the peoples involved in the org, salaries have to be limited even for key people and those with conflict of interests have to be severely rejected. Peoples have to show significant investment into the project before they can take part in the decision process. A fund have to be prepared in case members of the organization get intimidated or pressured.

### 14. Sustainable

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology and social platforms, many projects face challenges in maintaining their relevance and functionality over time. Often, platforms are built with short-term growth goals in mind, leading to technical debt and a lack of consideration for the social and ecological impacts. To ensure long-term viability and continued alignment with user needs, sustainability must be a core consideration from the outset.

Sustainability involves creating a platform that remains viable and relevant across generational timescales. This means choosing stable technologies, building maintainable systems, and establishing governance structures that can evolve with the community's needs. It means that every technical and architectural decision have to be taken with a long term perspective.

It is not about making rigid choices or avoiding new technologies and ideas. It is about the flexibility and adaptability to changing circumstances. Bold technical choices can be made if they are shown to closely match the *core principles*.

Systems should be designed for easy maintenance and scalability, with clear documentation and modular architecture to facilitate updates and improvements. Governance structures should be flexible, allowing for community input and adaptation to new circumstances. Feedback loops that identify areas for improvement have to be thought out to ensure the platform continues to meet user needs and remains aligned with its core principles over time.

### 15. Empirical

In the development of social platforms, assumptions about user behavior and feature effectiveness can lead to misguided decisions and unintended consequences. Without a rigorous approach to testing and validation, platforms risk implementing features that do not serve their intended purposes or align with their initial aim. An empirical approach is essential to ensure that platform development is grounded in reality and evidence.

The empirical principle emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making and rigorous testing. It involves gathering quantitative data (while respecting user privacy) but also qualitative feedbacks to study the concrete outcomes and to make adjustments based on evidence. This approach ensures that features and changes are evaluated for their actual impact, allowing the platform to evolve in a way that truly benefits its users.

Empirical does not mean relying solely on quantitative data or ignoring qualitative insights. It is not about reducing user experiences to mere numbers or metrics. Instead, it involves a balanced approach that considers both quantitative and qualitative data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of user interactions and platform dynamics.

To implement the empirical principle, the platform should establish robust mechanisms for data collection and analysis that is based on user agreement. A/B testing, user feedback loops, and pilot programs can be used to evaluate new features and changes. Regular reviews of platform performance and user satisfaction should inform ongoing development. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, the platform can ensure that its evolution is guided by real-world evidence and user needs.

### 16. Transparent

Transparency means users can understand how the platform works, from algorithms to governance. This requires clear documentation, open source code, and explicit explanation of automated systems.

This understanding enables meaningful user participation and control.

## Balancing Core principles

Each principle corresponds to a specific idea and are thought not to overlap with others but they might compete with one an other when it comes to practical implementation. The aim really is to find the best of both worlds whenever possible and to get to a good equilibrium between the two when they fundamentally contradict one an other. In this section we discuss some of them.

### Complexity vs Accessibility

Complexity grows quickly when designing systems. Giving complete control over the interface to the user (*empowering*) might make those really complex to use and understand. The processes able to parse and structure information (*informative*) might be extremely complex.

-- wip

### Privacy vs Openness

A lot of usage data has to be available in order to build good recommender systems (*expressive*). Privacy entails anonymity which makes it hard to discriminate bots and causes a lack of individual accountability (*empathic*, *democratic* and *informative*). It also hinders the ability to gather usage data that can inform the platform's development (*empirical*).

-- wip

## Requirements and Justifications

Here we propose a set of requirements that we justify in regards to the platform's core principles. We start every section with a wish list of features that would ideally be present. We then provide a list of possible solutions, their pros and cons.

### Platform's Name

The platform's name has to:

- Correspond to what it is: a social network
- Have a meaning that mirrors the platform's *core principles*
- Be readable and pronounceable in a large amount of languages (*accessible*)
- Be memorable (*attractive*)

#### Dialogue

- This is the current chosen name
- Pros:
  - Reflects the *empathic*, *expressive*, *collaborative* and *democratic* principles
  - Is easy to pronounce and has the same meaning in many languages
  - There is a clear social aspect making it sensible to label a social network
- Cons:
  - Probably won't get `dialogue.net`
  - SEO might be complicated

  - Its acronym isn't natural to read
  - Might be seen as piggy backing on the [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) ecosystem especially as it might not be built on top of it

### Dialogue Org

Dialogue Org is the non profit that gathers the various sources of revenue and redistributes them between the content creators and the developers that push the platform forward. It is a non profit that keeps its income and redistribution completely transparent to the public.

This organization is the initiator of the platform's culture and its members have to be the prime examples of its principles. Their behavior towards the rest of the community has to reflect that.

### Dialogue Org Governance

Governance might be the most difficult challenge of all. We have to take it very seriously as this is the deciding factor on weather the platform keeps upholding its *core principles* or weather it ends up steering in an unfavorable direction.

The governance of the platform must:

- Prevent state or corporate interests infiltrating the deciding bodies (*independent*)
- Reject opportunistic people from important roles to keep the platform on track with its *core principles*
- Keep the development process going even under state level interdiction and repression (*resilient*)
- Decision are taken publicly and have to be justified relative to the *core principles* (*transparent*)
- Functioning and decisions have to absolutely avoid unnecessary complexity and be comprehensible to non experts (*accessible*)
- Rigorously test and observe the outcomes of each decision (*empirical*)
- Able to quickly adapt to fix pressing issues (*sustainable*)
- Embodies the *humanistic* and *optimistic* principles
- Is under the control of involved users but also defend the interests of users that aren't able to involve themselves in the same way (*democratic*)
- Changes to the core principles have to be difficult enough for the project not to stere off course and easy enough for them not to become obsolete (*sustainable*)

#### Benevolent Dictatorship

- As the project is in its very infancy, this is the current mode of governance.
- Pros:
  - Decisions are taken quickly
  - Will follow the intent of the person who initiated the project
- Cons:
  - Simple to pressure a single person
  - Isn't impervious to bus accidents
  - Biased by the leader's socio-economic status

#### Open Democracy

- Cons:
  - Very hard to avoid [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)
  - Not implicated users are very likely to take poorly informed decisions
  - Organized interest groups might have oversized weight

#### Elm

[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

#### Gren

[Gren](https://gren-lang.org/)

#### Bend

[Bend](https://higherorderco.com/) seems great at compile time parallelization.

### Integrated Development Environment

Many developers have to coordinate their work in order to build this gargantuan project. A great integrated development environment is needed for them to find their way in one an other code.

### Graphical Interface Design Tool

Good interface design is key to every *social core principles* and having the right tooling is key in order to fulfil the complex requirements they imply. This tools aims at integrating the designers and developers workflows in an efficient way.

- Single source of truth for the design system, layout and animations
- Intuitive for designers
- The design should automatically generate code and have a simple interface for developers to integrate with
- All of the design has to be under designer control with the least amount of coding knowledge needed
- Ensure each interface works on any screen format
- Enforce accessibility

### Identity verification

Online group decision-making often requires some level of identity verification to avoid [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack).

#### The social graph of trust

One solution is to build a physical proof of personhood network where users meet in person and establish verified connections by scanning QR codes on each other's devices. This creates a social graph of trust that maintains privacy while making bot accounts detectable through network analysis.

Real human social networks tend to be densely interconnected, whereas bot accounts typically show suspicious patterns: few connections to verified humans, clustering through single gateway users, and unnatural network growth. While bad actors could attempt to verify bot accounts, their suspicious connection patterns would make them identifiable. The system becomes more robust as legitimate human connections accumulate, making it increasingly difficult to fake human-like network patterns at scale.

An organization can then use this network to validate identity. It could only consider votes entered by accounts with multiple trust connections to other members for instance.

-- Look at [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

### Default Recommendation System

-- wip

everyone doesn't need to give the same credence to everyone else. Give more credence to people close to you and to people you support the work. Explicitly recommend content to people around you.

### Multiformat

The platform has to handle many different media formats (*expressive*).

- each format has to
  - have a specific data structure
  - have an interface for the user to interact with it
  - have a set of metrics that can be used by recommender systems

### P2P Networking

Servers are a single point of failure that can easily be shut down by the cloud companies or the states. Organic peer to peer communication on the other hand is much harder to affect as every device of the network must get disconnected from the rest in order to shot down the service.

#### LibP2P

[LibP2P](https://libp2p.io/) is an open source networking library that has a very flexible transport layer with protocol multiplexing. According to their website it is the simplest solution for global scale peer-to-peer networking and includes support for pub-sub message passing, distributed hash tables, NAT hole punching and browser-to-browser direct communication. It is still under active development but is used in production in many large scale contexts.

### Collaborative Storage Cloud

[Collaborative storage cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_storage_cloud)

### Payment Method

Payment methods have to be available in order to finance the work of content creators, pay compensations on the collaborative storage cloud.

- the *Dialogue Org* will provide content crowd funding (*accessible* and *sustainable*)
- payments in filecoin will be possible independently of that service (*resilient*)
- the *Dialogue Org* might provide filecoin exchange (*accessible* and *sustainable*)

### Architecture

In order to articulate all perviously cited systems we need a clear architecture.

- Must enable interface and algorithmic modularity by providing specific api for the different variations of these systems to be integrated through

#### Key Concepts / Ontology

Organizing :

- Entity : Anything that interacts with the app. This covers *bots*, *people* and *orgs*.
- Person : Specifically describes a human user.
- Bot : Computer program interacting with the platform. It may gather data and/or publish *content*.
- Sybil : Computer program pretending to be a human user.
- Org : Group of *entities* organizing together. They have an *aim*, *processes* and a *record*. It might be publicly visible or private in which case only its *members* know it exists. *Members* may share *content* internally.
- Member : *Entity* that is part of an *org*.
- Aim : Piece of text describing the goals, intended purposes and general orientation of an *org*. The introduction and the *core principles* together form *Dialogue Org*'s *aim*.
- Action : Different actions can be taken by an *org*. This mey be internal *content* moderation, *content* publication and management, modifications of the *aim*, *member* acceptance and exclusion, *role* edition, granting and removal, modifications of *processes*, etc.
- Process : Methods and criterions by which *action* can be taken within an *org*. The mechanisms mey include direct voting, temporary role granting through voting or [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition), committee deliberation, etc. Its functioning has to be *transparent* to every *member*.
- Record : List of every *action* taken.
- Role : *Members* hold different *roles* within an *org* that charge them with some responsibilities and may grants them the right to take a specific *actions*. A piece of text describes the expected behavior of the holder.

Publishing :

- Content : Piece of content matching a specific *format*. It is owned by an *entity* which is the only one able to modify its *auth* data.
- Format : Standard structure of *content* data, metadata and presentation material (miniature, description, etc.). This might cover things like articles, posts, long form video, short vertical video, music, podcast, book, comment, etc.
- Interaction : Way a *person* can interact with a specific piece of *content*. Might be likes, views, reactions, votes, modifications, etc. They only represent quantitative data.
- Groupings : *Format* that groups other *contents* together. This might be photo or music albums, playlists, reading lists, feeds, etc.
- Auth : Data structure describing which *entities* get to access and/or *interact* in specific ways with a given piece of *content*. All *content* except for public one is encrypted. *Entities* that have reading rights on the content are the only ones to receive the decryption key.
- Ownership : Every piece of *content* is owned by an *entity* which is the only one able to modify its *auth*. *Content* is *owned* by its initial emitter but can be transferred to a different *entity*.
- Signature : Cryptographic signature ensuring the authenticity of the piece of data. Every *content* and *interaction* have to be signed. Different kinds of [group signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_signature) mey be used in the case of *org* signatures.

Interfaces :

- Component : Piece of interface serving a specific purpose.
- Layout : Piece of interface organizing various *components* on the screen. It may then itself be used as a *component*.
- Page : *Layout* covering the whole screen that has a specific url/address.
- Design : Set of parameters that can be edited by the *person* which decides on the aesthetic and usability of *components* and *layouts*. It describes dark and light mode colors, font sizes, weather assisting tools are needed, etc.

Presenting :

- Metric : Some meaningful information extracted from the pile of raw data by a deterministic algorithm. It may measure the amount of views a piece of *content* got while avoiding to count *sybils*, it might measure how much a specific *person* enjoyed a piece of *content* or extract keywords representing the topic it covered.
- Recommendation : List of *content* organized by an algorithm through various criterions to a specific *person*. It tries to predict which *content* the given *person* would want to access next based on various *metrics* and based on the *content* that the *person* may be currently reading/watching.
- Presentation : *Page* enabling a *person* to read/watch and *interact* with a piece of *content*.
- Miniature : *Component* presenting a piece of *content* that enable the *person* to access its *page* or add it to various content *groupings*.
- Discovery : *Layout* presenting the *miniatures* of *contents* selected by different *recommendation* systems for the *person* to search through.

## Notes

Various notes and precisions about this document.

### Is the systemic change described in the introduction even possible?

The current socio-economic system - capitalism - is only 300 years old which is ridiculous when compared to the 300,000 years modern humans have been around. Like organisms, societies evolve, they adapt to external threats and iteratively transform to solve their internal contradictions.

Moreover, the seeds are planted: On one hand, we inherited productive capabilities able to provide for everyone's needs enabling their participation to the political process. On the other, our transport and communication capabilities literally shrunk the scale of our planet and give us the opportunity to meet and discuss across continents.

We made this statement to clarify the intention behind the project but even if you believe such a deep political transformation of society to be impossible, a tool like Dialogue has many immediate positive impacts and is worth pursuing for its own sake. Every *core principle* might individually be a good reason for someone to want to build and support it.

### Will the far-right be using Dialogue to their advantage?

The core values of the far right are fundamentally centered around creating hierarchies between people and to violently oppress those who they deem as lesser humans. Those are fundamentally opposed to many of the platform's *core principles* and - as such - we strongly reject their perspective. We know the far right short and aggressive messaging to be very viral on online platforms and they will surely attempt to invade every spaces and prevent constructive dialogue to happen.

-- wip : feels unclear and insufficient but I've got to complete more of the requirements first

Online public spaces are hard to defend but good moderation does prevent harmful messaging to be spread. We aim at structuring and confining information based on ideology which will confine their messaging within a given ideological space that can be visited and interacted with but would be compartmented from the others where those ideologies are inappropriate it easy for people to explore other perspectives without being invaded by disruptive uninformed interventions.

Far right groups will probably enjoy the privacy of the platform and its tools to organize but they are already welcomed and supported by the mainstream media and private social platforms. They do not need one more space for them to use. That is not the case for human rights activists, investigative journalists, feminist groups, whistle blowers and other radical left movements which get increasingly rejected. Those groups will be able to keep communicating and organizing on Dialogue even under heavy state and corporate repression

### On our use of LLMs

Parts of this document have been written in collaboration with a LLM and similar tools will likely be used to implement the platform.

We recognize that these algorithms have been trained in problematic ways using data without author's acknowledgement and poorly paid labor for data labeling. This kind of recognition can equally be given to the manner the computers and servers internet is built on have been assembled and their materials mined.

We believe LLMs as much as any other tool can be used for human emancipation. A hammer can break a skull but it mey also serve to build bridges, houses and hospitals. In other words, the deleterious conditions that produced that hammer may be changed with the help of that very hammer. This reasoning works as much for LLMs as for textile factories and mining industries.

In terms of content originality, we do not attempt to be especially original or novel. Our main aim is to express ideas and develop techniques to bring them to life. No matter who or what expresses those ideas as long as they correspond to our thoughts and needs.

We have made the writing process transparent by sharing the dialogue's history. It can be found in the `.aider.chat.history.md` file.

### Our view on intellectual property

-- wip

Intellectual property is an important concept that makes it possible for people to be paid and receive social recognition for their creative and intellectual work. Though we strongly defend this version of intellectual property, we also reject absolutely the way this notion is used to privatize knowledge and turn it into merchandise to be sold and gatekeeped by large multinational corporations.

We provide software to be used by people to share content

- like people who code the torrent client and protocol we are not responsible for the files shared and hosted by the users
- though we will do what we can for content creators to get due recognition and pay for their work
- and we will absolutely try to spread revenue amongst small creators enabling them to live from their work instead of concentrating it in the hands of a few larger ones that either turn into corporations or are already produced by one

## Legacy and wip Text

### Pro-Social Behavior

- Users can make one to one or group chats.
- Users can post content and decide who gets access to it.

### Organization Tools

- Users form organizations and set rules for their functioning.
- Debate and messaging systems encourage constructive dialogue.
- Voting systems are modular and transparent to every member.
- Texts and rules can be collaboratively edited, reviewed and voted.
- Inclusion and expulsion mechanisms are set up as rules.
- Roles can be attributed and revoked via votes.
- Debate surrounding every rule and text is made available and structured in an accessible fashion.

### Content Moderation

- Content moderation is managed by the users.
- Individuals and organizations can provide custom algorithms and metrics as extensions.

### Accessible

- Low technical and cultural barriers.
- [Accessible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility) to people with disabilities.

### International

- People should be able to communicate and organize across linguistic and national barriers.
- The design of the interface must be adaptable for various cultural and linguistic environments.

### Data Privacy

- Data has to be fully encrypted and under user's informed control.
- Defaults always protects user's privacy.
- Users have control over where they store their data.

### Local First and Fully Distributed

The app has to function as [local first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) so that it stays up even under heavy network partitioning.

**Principles**:

- Keep the primary copy of the data on the local device.
- Synchronize data across all of the user's devices.
- Works fine without an Internet connection.
- Support real-time collaboration.
- Downloadable from any other user's device.
- Users can take part in a [cooperative storage cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_storage_cloud) for long term storage.
- Users can take part in cooperative [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) in order to run algorithms that are too heavy to function locally.

**Useful Inspirations**:

- [any-sync](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync) for automatic conflict resolution.
- [automerge](https://automerge.org/) for automatic conflict resolution.
- [ipns](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/) for content addressing.
- [socket-runtime](https://github.com/socketsupply/socket) for network buffering.

### Payment System

A payment solution has to be provided as many services required for the platform to function need money to be exchanged.

> Some of the principles below are mathematically impossible. They are quite naive and need more precision.

**Principles**:

- Secure and reliable.
- Anonymous and untraceable.
- Keeps working under heavy network partitioning.
- Byzantine resistant.

**Useful Inspirations**:

- [filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) as a cooperative storage cloud with a reward model, it also doubles as a crypto currency.

### Easy to Customize

Essentially everything in Dialogue has to be customizable for it to match all of its constraints.

**Principles**:

- The programming language used for extensions has to be easy to learn, debug and maintain.
- GUI are provided where possible.
- APIs accessed by extensions must be constrained enough to make code injection or the use of any other hacking methods impossible.

**Useful Inspirations**:

- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

### Hard to Track

The software should withstand state level interdiction and make its users as innocuous as possible.

> This would be ideal but I'm out of my technical depth here.

**Principles**:

- The network communications made between clients have to be innocuous and untraceable.
- It should be possible to make the app hardly recognizable by any other software on the device.

**Useful Inspirations**:

- [Metamorphic code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_code) can be used to make the app unrecognizable.

### Development Financing

The shopping list is long and we will need a lot of resources to get there.

> This is the main pain point. How can we make people accountable?
> This section is very insufficient and idealistic in my opinion.

**Principles**:

- Money only is a mean to an end.
- Development must be done without any profit motive.
- Money is only used to free the most involved volunteers time.
- The hourly pay is fixed and equal for everyone.
- The way the development team is financed must be - if not aligned - at least compatible with the goals of the project otherwise it is better to only involve volunteers.

**Possible Revenue Sources**:

- Providing a market for easily exchanging the platform's currency with circulating ones.
- Consulting for companies and non profits that would like to function in a democratic fashion and would benefit by integrating Dialogue into their organization.
- User's donations under a set threshold to avoid large donators getting leverage.


## Design Ideas

- Detect aggressive or hurtful writing in a post or comment and prompt the user to think about the people that message might hurt before posting it online.
- Users can setup custom content flagging systems and share their flags with one an other.
- Users can code their own recommender systems.

- Different versions of the interface can be provided as extensions.
- Translation algorithms can be provided as extensions and hosted on the user's devices.


## Existing Propositions

> I want to review a lot more existing social media in order to pull inspiration. Here is a set that will be interesting to review:
> Mastodon, Matrix, Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB), Aether, Lemmy, Discord, Signal, Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, WeChat, Twitch, Medium, BeReal, Clubhluse

### Nebula

Nebula is a video-on-demand streaming service provider. Launched by the Standard Broadcast content management agency in 2019 to complement its creators' other distribution channels (primarily YouTube), the platform has since accumulated over 650,000 subscribers, making it the largest creator-owned internet streaming platform.<sup>[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_(streaming_service))</sup>

#### Strong Points

- As it is creator-owned, they get to collectively decide on the functioning of the platform and ensures it follows the best interest of the members.
- The creators drive the development by having Nebula sponsoring their Youtube content. In turn the platform pays the creators for the watchtime they get on Nebula. This forms a positive feedback loop.
- They get huge benefits by negotiating group deals with sponsors, microphone brands, stock footage providers, sound editing software, branding designers, etc.
- Content moderation is ensured by selecting the creators that are part of the project which might be decided collectively.

#### Weaknesses

- The creators only own half of the platform and get a 50-50 deal and probably half of the decision making power.
- The creators generally come from a specific socioeconomic background and mostly from the US or the UK as it only is english speaking.
- Creators can hardly have dissenting stances to the collective. Second thought leaving the platform might be an example of this.
- The profitability of the company also is a constraint on creators political stances as the sponsors and partners could pressure Nebula.
