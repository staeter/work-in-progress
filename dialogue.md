# Dialogue

Dialogue is a tool for people to constructively discuss, debate and organize despite state repression.

- Its default interfaces and algorithms are biased toward constructive and creative interactions.
- It is built as light weight local first software accessible to people with any computer literacy.
- Data is fully encrypted and stored on user's devices.
- Users can easily adapt any part of their interfaces and algorithms and create extensions.

## Social Challenges

The hardest part of building Dialogue won't be technical but social. Tons of social networks have been built and compete for user's time and attention.
The huge challenge is to get people on board while avoiding the predatory methods used by major existing social networks.

## International

We want people from any country and cultural environment to be able to use the platform and to potentially communicate with anyone else on the platform.
Making Dialogue accessible in many languages and help with interlingual communication is necessary for all of this.

## Decision making

As dialogue is made to be used in so many contexts it has to be extremely modular and have a system of distributed decision making for every user in the world to get interfaces and interactions that are made to
Decision making
-> give as much control to the user while helping them to make informed decisions and provide defaults that are in the individual's interest


## User Experience Challenges

Design interfaces that encourage rich and constructive dialogue is a huge challenge. It is extremely easy to spread short and misinformed messaging. To counter it we usually need a lot of moderation, but as we keep the data under user's control and the platform is built as a distributed system we need users to make their own content moderation. We will have to provide tooling to make this task as easy and accessible as possible so that Dialogue becomes a place that fosters fulfilling interactions. This can go through transparent and modular recommendation algorithms and through.

## Technical Challenges

The big question here is make this system resistant to state level attacks. The network layer has to be Byzantine resistant
secure but extensible and programable
distributed system
long term and short term storage
payment methods
distributed computation for power computation
